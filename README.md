# Data Quality Monitoring

## Overview

This Python script provides a simple framework for monitoring the quality of data in a CSV file. It utilizes the pandas library to read and analyze numerical columns, identifying anomalies and raising alerts if data quality issues are detected.

## Features

- Automated data quality checks for numerical columns in a CSV file.
- Customizable threshold for anomaly detection.
- Easy integration into existing data pipelines.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have ```Python``` installed on your system.

2. Install the required dependencies:
```Pandas Dataframe```

## Configuration
You can customize the following parameters in the script:

- ```data_file_path:``` Specify the path to your CSV file.
- ```threshold_value:``` Set the threshold for anomaly detection.

## Application of the Script

**1. Data Preprocessing in Machine Learning:**
- Before training machine learning models, it's crucial to ensure the quality of the input data.
- This script can help identify anomalies or outliers in the numerical features, allowing you to preprocess the data before feeding it into a machine learning algorithm.

**2. Quality Checks in ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Processes:**
- When dealing with large datasets and ETL processes, it's essential to monitor the quality of the data at each stage.
- This script can be integrated into your ETL pipeline to perform checks on numerical columns and raise alerts if any issues are detected.

**3. Monitoring Data Feeds:**
- If you receive periodic data feeds or updates, this script can be used to automatically check the quality of the incoming data.
- Anomalies or unexpected patterns in the numerical data can be quickly identified and addressed.

**4. Financial Data Analysis:**
- In financial data analysis, anomalies or outliers in numerical data can be significant indicators of potential issues or opportunities.
- This script can be applied to financial datasets to identify unusual patterns or values.

**5. Regular Data Audits:**
- Incorporating this script into regular data auditing processes helps ensure that your datasets maintain a high level of quality over time.
- It can be scheduled to run at specified intervals to catch any emerging data quality issues.

**6. Customized Data Monitoring Scenarios:**
- The script is designed to be easily customizable. Users can adjust the threshold for anomaly detection and tailor the script to specific data quality requirements.
- This flexibility makes it suitable for a wide range of data monitoring scenarios.
